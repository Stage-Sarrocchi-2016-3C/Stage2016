# Stage Plan

## Objectives

The intern at the end of the stage have to reach:

* Good knowledge about
  * Data Structures
  * Algorithms
  * Developer's workbench tools
* Good adaptability behaviour to face successfully the future challenges in the real work world (survive being the protagonist of his own working life)

## Work to do

the intern have to present a paper ([written as a markdown text file](https://speckyboy.com/2013/12/04/markdown-tools-editors/)) explaining his understanding about the following topics/chapters (please check/analyse the *Refs* to evince the details):
